# Loan_eligibility_prediction_system
Loan Eligiility  is defined as a set of criteria basis which a financial institution evaluates to decide the eligibility of a customer for a particular loan.

Loan Eligibility is decided after a long and intensive process of verification of documents and validation of set of criteria which takes a huge amount of time.

To avoid this time consuming process. I developed a system that predict whether a person is eligible for the loan based on information filled in the loan application form which contains all the criteria for validating.

Criteria include- 
Loan Amount
Dependents
Marital Status
Applicant income
Gender
Credit history
Loan Amount term
